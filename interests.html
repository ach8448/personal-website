                    <p>I was introduced to programming in my junior year of high school. Coding was fun, but it was when
                        I got to college and exposed myself to more of the Computer Science field that I developed a
                        fascination for the opportunities and solutions that are possible. Data analytics and Product
                        Management are fields that I intend to pursue, and I look forward to honing my skills in these
                        industries! </p>

                        <p>Many researchers have high expectations regarding AI being the solution to many of our
                            problems.
                            However, many are talking about full automation. There is limited work done that prioritizes
                            including human participation, which I believe is where the most potential lies. If we don't
                            aim
                            to
                            change habits, automation is only a short-term solution.</p>
